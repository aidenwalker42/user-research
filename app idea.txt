Problem:
	Trying to plan a party/night out or a simple dinner with friends can be a hassle.
	Coordinating with multiple persons and making sure everyone is satisfied on where and when to meet is one of the reasons.
	Constant inflow of message and having to look up responses inside a group chat is another among many.
